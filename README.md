## Outils specification & version

## Informations about Docker images

## Instructions about running the application via Docker

## API documentation

## Top-down style
As we're a team of 4 people, we've chosen to follow the top-down style. We began to document our REST API with Swagger in yaml. Then :
* software quality engineers implement API tests in Javascript.
* software developers implement the API in Java with Spring Boot.

## Instruction for running automatised Mocha Tests
run `npm install` then `npm test` in `tests`directory
